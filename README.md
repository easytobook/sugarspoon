sugarspoon
==========

Testrunner framework using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) ([Chai](http://chaijs.com)) and [Blanket.js](http://blanketjs.org)


Features
--------

* **Easy configuration** of Blanket.js with Mocha and AMD (based on the mochablanket adapter provided by Blanket.js)
* **Toggle Blanket.js coverage** with automatic browser reload
* **Persisted test settings** ("mocha report", "coverage report" and "show fixtures") across reloads (using HTML5 local storage)


Background
----------

I wanted to unit test my JavaScript code and optionally have coverage reporting. Although Blanket.js has some separate examples of usage with AMD/RequireJS and Mocha, I found it non-trivial to get the combination to work.

Also, since adding Blanket.js introduces quite a bit of overhead (feels about 2x slower with coverage reporting enabled), I wanted a way to quickly enable or disable coverage in the Mocha web UI.

While I was at it, I also added some extra configuration options to show/hide the detailed Mocha output itself, as well as some very simple HTML fixtures management (Backbone view elements).

Screenshots
-----------

Compared to the standard Mocha HTML output, sugarspoon adds a settings bar at the bottom:

Files names in the coverage report can be clicked to show line-based coverage (this is standard Blanket.js):

Installation
------------

    $ bower install sugarspoon


Usage
-----

See the [example](example) directory for details.

Note: to get accurate coverage reporting using RequireJS when running Mocha tests selectively (using the `grep` request parameter), you should take care to load the code to under test *from within your tests*.

**Wrong**:

```coffee
define (require) ->
  # this will load 'component', even if the test suite below is not run
  MyComponent = require 'component'

  describe 'My component', ->
    it 'does some cool stuff', ->
      (new MyComponent).doSomething()
```


**Right**:

```coffee
define (require) ->

  describe 'My component', ->
    before (done) ->
      require ['component'], (@MyComponent) => done()

    it 'does some cool stuff', ->
      (new @MyComponent).doSomething()
```

Changelog
---------

### 0.3-dev

* Added `baseTest()`, `viewTest()`, `modelTest()` and `collectionTest()` utility functions, along with unit tests for their functionality.
* Added a special `meta/sanitcheck` test suite

### 0.2.2

* Fix leftbehind `loadNpmTasks` calls in Gruntfile
* Renamed `adapters` and `runners` directories to `adapter` and `runner`

### 0.2.1

* Fix semver tag for bower

### 0.2.0

* Mocha is no longer loaded using RequireJS â€“ it should be loaded through a regular script tag instead. This is for [compatibility with grunt-mocha](https://github.com/kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha#amd).
* The API of the `TestRunner.run()` has changed; instead of passing the actual modules to run, you should now pass a list of module names to be loaded (using RequireJS). The TestRunner now makes sure to execute the test suites in order. Note that you still have to make sure to return a function from the test module instead of the direct call to `describe()`.
* Removed default Blanket `filter` in the `CoverageRunner`. Configuration options for Blanket can now be passed to the `TestRunner` as a `blanketOptions` object. The `coverage` option on the `TestRunner` has been removed.
* Added [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org) and [coffeelint](http://www.coffeelint.org) for syntax checking.
* Changed Sugarspoon source code from 4 spaces to 2 spaces.

### 0.1.1

* More flexible jQuery dependency in `bower.json`; any 2.x version should be fine.

### 0.1.0

* First public release; mostly to be considered as proof-of-concept


TODO
----
* Allow for more flexible configuration
* Add support for Jasmine (as alternative to Mocha)
* Test (and add support if necessary) for non-AMD configuration
